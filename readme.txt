Programming Language used: Python 3 and version 3.9.13

How the code is structured?
In Python, I have used the sys module to import system arguments.

About code:
The following are the functions that I declared in my code,

final_score(): This function is used to calculate the final score of players whether they have won or lost based on the versions.

red_blue_nim(): In this function, as given in the instructions, I have checked for <version> and <first_player>, and based on that I have specified the move ordering and it is working alternatively between each player and finally it calculates the winning or losing score.


Running Instructions:
As specified in the description you can check as follows,

red_blue_nim.py <num-red> <num-blue> <version> <first-player> <depth>
eg: 
python red_blue_nim.py 5 7 standard computer 5
python red_blue_nim.py 5 7 misere computer 5
python red_blue_nim.py 5 7 standard 5
python red_blue_nim7.py 5 7 5
